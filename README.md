This project is about engineering and refining a machine learning model that can help health care facilities
better evaluate the risk of death in patients with COVID/flu-like symptoms.

It is often difficult to predict whether a patient is at high risk of death when many patients with similar 
symptoms can have drastically different outcomes. With a model that can accurately predict this, health care 
professionals will have another metric to decide how to treat different patients, allowing health care facilities 
to save more lives and potentially save resources for lower risk patients. This model is not intended to be a 
singular solution to determine a patient's care, but rather a quick and efficient aid to help make a better decision, faster.

The dataset we found was provided by the Mexican government, and contains over 1 million records of different 
people that were presented with flu-like symptoms. The dataset includes age, recorded symptoms, the level of 
care they received, their date of death (if they died), and several related pre-conditions that could potentially 
help predict the patient's future. There is a total of 21 features.
